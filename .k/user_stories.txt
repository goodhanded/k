  "summary": "This project plan outlines a series of user stories to implement a full sprint cycle workflow in k. The new workflow will generate a detailed project plan from a prompt, produce structured changesets for code modifications, run tests automatically and iteratively, and evaluate results until all tests pass and acceptance criteria are met. Each user story represents a small, discrete unit of work that, when combined, delivers a robust, automated sprint cycle.",
